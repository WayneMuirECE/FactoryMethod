# FactoryMethod
Design Patterns Project:
This is a simple project used to learn the factory method pattern in C#.

This version allows a client to pull data from two different data sources so that it can be stored in a new data source.
The story behind this version is: Two companies are merging and need to merge their employee databases into a combind database.
